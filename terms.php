            <h5>COVID-19</h5>

            <p>An inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. According to the WHO senior citizens and guests with underlying medical conditions are especially vulnerable. We ask that you please take personal responsibility for your wellbeing. This begins with packing any personal protective equipment and sanitizers you require. Please adopt physical distancing and hygiene practices throughout your pre-trip travel arrangements and follow all health instruction whether physical signage, or requests from our professional staff once you are vacationing with us. To travel with GET and its Operating Brands, you voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19.</p>

            <p>We highly recommend all guests purchase travel insurance that includes trip interruption, trip delay, medical expense coverage and evacuation protection covering all applicable dates of travel with GET and its Operating Brands. The recommended minimum coverage levels are listed below. This insurance must cover: trip interruption, trip delay, emergency evacuation and medical expenses resulting from illness related to a pandemic event, such as COVID-19. Further, the insurance must include coverage for a medically imposed quarantine such as a result of a guest in the group contracting COVID-19 while traveling with GET and its Operating Brands. Please be aware that most travel insurance providers require you to purchase your insurance coverage within a certain timeframe from you paying your deposit or your final payment (depending on type of coverage). Guests are advised to research and purchase insurance as soon as possible after paying their deposit.
